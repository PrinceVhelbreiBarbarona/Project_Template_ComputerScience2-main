📝 Project Title
HACS (Hospital Order and Communication System)

🔍 Problem Statement
Problems like heavy staff workloads and increasing hospital costs is worth solving because they can affect how patients are taken care of inside a hospital

🎯 Project Objectives
Write at least 2–3 clear objectives your project aims to achieve. Example:

Objective 1: To analyze and summarize data from the chosen JSON dataset.
Objective 2: To help users gain meaningful insights (e.g., averages, trends, patterns).
Objective 3: To practice JSON handling and Python programming concepts.
⚙️ Planned Features
Your program must have at least 5 features (minimum).
We have provided 2 starter ideas for each dataset — you must design at least 3 additional features.

Feature 1: count how many visits a patient has made
Feature 2: List the doctors a patient has consulted
Feature 3: Identify what a patient was diagnosed with
Feature 4: Identify which demographic of patients prefer which doctors
Feature 5: Identify habits of doctor prescription

⌨️ Planned Inputs and Outputs
Inputs

What kind of data will the user provide (if any)?
Example: Patient ID, Doctor name

What kind of results will your program display?
Example: class averages, top products, weather summary
🧠 Logic Plan
Choose ONE way to describe your program’s logic:

Option 1: Pseudocode
Write your steps in plain English. Example:
Load JSON file Display menu of features If user chooses "1", compute average grade per student If user chooses "2", list all borrowed books Repeat until user exits program

Option 2: Flowchart
Attach or draw a flowchart showing how the program will work.
